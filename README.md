  **Wireframe**

The original website started by making sketches on paper, a rough work of what was intended to be created.  As the idea became clearer, the knowledge was transferred to [Balsamiq App](https://balsamiq.com/)for the design architechture and  the site wireframe was designed. Although, there were some minor changes in the design but mostly the layout on the app gave the guidance, a step by step guard to build the final website. Below is the link to the wireframe for the desktop and mobile devices.
