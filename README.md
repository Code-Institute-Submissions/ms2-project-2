## Design Choices



The concept behind this site was borne from my love for the planet, on how better human can treat her so that this generation can bequeath her to the next generation. Also, the idea of building the game was inspired by a Youtube video [PortEXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ) that I watched on how a Halloween card was built.  I therefore, thought of how to sensitize audience on climate change impact, mitigation and adaptation while at the same having fun.

I thought the concept would be good for a memory games partly due to different images, colors and above all the subconcious learning part of it. I wanted a game site that will be highly interactive with quiet and less distractive music to go with the game.



### Fonts

[Google Fonts!](https://fonts.google.com/) Two main fonts were used for the whole sites:

* Supermercado for the body with fall back on san serif.
* Langar for the headers with with fall back on san serif.






### Design

#### **Colour Scheme**

The developer used [eggradients](https://www.eggradients.com/shades-of-green-color) to choose colors that were used in creating the website. Particularly, 5 colors were used and they signify what the sites stands for.
  * RGBArgba(90, 150, 210, 0.95): this is a shade of light-blue which is very important in in nature and climate change, it also signifies healing and health for sustainable development.
  * #ffffff: it signify purity and pristine.
  * RGBA(255,36,0, 0.8): It is a shade of red for cheerfulness, energy, and enthusiasm for the future and hope those for that need support.
  * Goldenrod this is a shade of golden-yellow, it signifies the worthiness.
  * rgba(0, 73, 83, 0.9): It is Sherpa Blue, it signifies the sky and the sea.
  * #777777: It is form of dark gray.
  * #FFBB89: It is Orange-like color which signifies creativity and vitality
  * rgba(195, 212, 37, 0.8)

 
 

 ### Content Section
For the game section, the cards will be layed out in a 4 by 4 grid for all devices. User will start by clicking on the slightly dark transparent overlay. Once started the user will hear the music background and clock will be starts counting down. The game title will be at the top.  The cards will flip on clicking and players will have to match pairs. If they are wrong cards flip back and the player continues. When the cards matches, that is, the center images at the card's front, it will sway in a dancing animation and remained cardfront, flipped.  If the user can't complete the game before the time runs out, there will be a Game over message accompanied with some melancholic sound for losing. In addition there will be a click to restart message on the screen so that the user can click again on the screen to try again. If all the cards matched, the user will get a Winner message on the screen and click to restart mesage, also there will an upbeat victory sound. The overall objective, is to get user engaged.

# Testing


***Sites Validation***

I used the following webistes to validate the site HTML, CSS, and Javascript files respectively.

* [HTML-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input")
* [CSS-validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input")
* [Jshint](https://jshint.com/)





    * The HTML validated the codes without any errors.
        [HTML test](assets/testing/homepagehtml.png) 
    * Similarly, the CSS validator checked the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and nd it is without errors.
        [CSS test](assets/testing/homepagecss.png)
    * Furthermore, the website was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.
      and it works perfectly in them.
      * Systems: Macbook Pro Laptop, HP laptop, and Lenovo laptop.
      * Browsers: Chrome, Opera, Edge, Firefox, Safari
      * Phones and Tabs: iPad Pro, different Iphone series and androids

    
 * -For the game testing-

*    [HTML test](assets/testing/cardgamehtml.png)

*    [CSS test](assets/testing/cardcss.png)

* -For the JavaScript:
JS-Hint Findings: When using the tool about 15 warnings flagged, warnings has to do basicallly with the 'arrow function syntax (=>)' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6'). But i am sure confortable with it and the code is working perfectly,  however, I have taken note of that for next project. Also, there was another alert of one unused variable at the bottom. The variable was actually used and called in the home page section to control the a "Read More" button. However, all the codes work perfectly. Below are the two images.

[Javascript test](assets/testing/jshint1.png)

[Javascript test](assets/testing/jshint15.png)

* Chrome DevTools
        [Javascript test](assets/testing/devToolz.png)


 * Chrome DevTools
        [Lighthouse test](assets/testing/gamemobilLit.png)
        [Lighthouse test](assets/testing/lighthouse2.png)


* [lighthouse Audit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse): Performance, and accessibility test was conducted using the lighthouse tool option on chrome developer tool and generating a report for the selected device, to ensure the suitability and maximum performance for users. The first image was Intially generated for desktop view.

<img src="assets/testing/lighthousetest1.png">

The results above is 88%, after further cleaning and editing of the codes such removal of used codes and properly nestling some divs, the second image was generated which is 91% performance, though the developer strive for 100% which could be obtainable at the moment but hope to achive in future project. Below is the second image generated.

<img src="assets/testing/lighthouse2.png">


The results for mobile is 90%, although it is not terrible such a score but would strive to improve the score where needed to enhance it future performance. Below is the image from the mobile view.

<img src="assets/testing/gamemobilLit.png">






## Bugs and resolve

1. **Naviagational bar**
    * In the game section, the Naviagational bar overlaps the Timer and the flipper due to the height of the game container both on desktop and in mobile view.
    * In addition, in the mobile view of the game, the logo overlaps the timer and flip counter.

 ### Resolve
 * The issues was resolved by making the colour and footer of the game section transparent, also by changing the styling from justify-content-center to  justify-content: space-between;.
 * Lastly, on the mobile device the logo was hidden.

1. **Responsiveness**

* Intially, the following problems were identified
  <img src="assets/testing/mobileunfit.png">
 * The 2 layout columns was not just good for the mobile view, it was not user-friendly, that was way code was initially built.
 length of card was just too long for media of 600px and below.
 ### Resolve
* The problem was resolve by applying media query of max-width 600px, and changing the layout into 4 columns.
* The method worked for all the small mobile devices except Iphone 5 series. Again, I had to apply another media query of max-width 350px. That resolve problems of Responsiveness and compactibility.
see here for the images [media@600](assets/testing/responsivecode2.png), and [media@600](assets/testing/responsivecode.png)

2. **Floating footer**
   * There was the footer problem that would not stick to the bottom. After doing lot of research by googling, and watching lot of youtube videos, finally there was solution after an interactive section with an online tutor.
    <img src="assets/testing/footerfloat.png">

### Resolve

 * It was because I hard coded the footer height. I had to remove the height value for it to be resolve
    <img src="assets/testing/footerfloat1.png">


3. **Toggle Issue**
    * There was an issue of a button that has to be toggle twice before it reponded. The button was the Read More button in the centre of the jumbotron in the homepage. 
    * the major problem was because  <button class="btn btn-lg btn--cta btn--red hvr-grow-shadow read-moreButton expandToggle" onclick="readMore()">Read More..</button> the expandToggle class was used and also, in the Javascript the style was displayed none instead of block as can be seen in code below.
    {(var showContent = document.getElementById("showMoreContent1"); if (showContent.style.display === "none") )}

    <img src="assets/testing/footerfloat1.png">

### Resolve 
* The class expandToggle was removed and the style-display was changed from none to block.


### Unresolve issues
One unresolved issue was in the game section, when the 
card flips, the its background is white. the card is not supposed to have a whit background when it flips, although when card flips completely , the white background does not show. I did lot of researches but could fix it yet. It is one problem that the developer would fix if there was enough time.

## * The Game section*

### *Game Startup page*

 * The page loads with a ready-to-use display such as **Click to Start**. 
 * It has a slightly dark transparent overlay. Game starts on click and the timer starts counting down while the flip notes the number of flips the user makes. 
 * Since the aim of the game is to test user memory against the timer, the start click also starts the clock this is to maximize time. Below image is the start-up screen.

### *Active Game Mode and back of cards*

* The active view of the game has the game Title, Timer, flip counter, cards and background sound. Below is an image.
* The card images enlarge when player or user hovers over the back of the cards, it animates and grows toward the center of the card.
* The five images at the back of the card represent items which are very significant to climate change.
* In the following order: Top-Left-Right, Bottom-Right-Left and center, the images are Carbondioxide molecule (Co2), Nitrous oxide molecule N2O, methane molecule (CH4), chloroflourocarbon molecule (CFC) and image of the earth.
* Those images except that of the earth are gases that causes green-house-gas (GHG), which are the major anthropogenic factors that cause climate change

### Future Features to be Implemeneted 

   *-for the homepage*

* To implement user accounts to keep details securely.
* To ensure the functionality of the email and sign-up form. 
* Add my personal profile.
* More quotes the quote section
* To include have access to a huge variety of games for learning a second or third language.
* The Social media such as the facebook, instagram, twitter, linkedin will open link to CCMG instead of developer personal account. 

   *-for the game*

1. The the cardgame html will be fully be built with JavaScript or Json for easy scaling, flexibility, maintainance and to add new features. 

2. Different Levels

 * To add different levels in game, which will include easy level and hard level. This would be archieved either by increasing the number of cards with lesser time or other new techniques. Having different difficulties level in the game would sure get users to test to be more engaged espacialyy when it comes to tesing their memories against racing time. 







  **Wireframe**

The original website started by making sketches on paper, a rough work of what was intended to be created.  As the idea became clearer, the knowledge was transferred to [Balsamiq App](https://balsamiq.com/)for the design architechture and  the site wireframe was designed. Although, there were some minor changes in the design but mostly the layout on the app gave the guidance, a step by step guard to build the final website. Below is the link to the wireframe for the desktop and mobile devices.
