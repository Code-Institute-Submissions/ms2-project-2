   *-for the game*

1. The the cardgame html will be fully be built with JavaScript or Json for easy scaling, flexibility, maintainance and to add new features. 

2. Different Levels

 * To add different levels in game, which will include easy level and hard level. This would be archieved either by increasing the number of cards with lesser time or other new techniques. Having different difficulties level in the game would sure get users to test to be more engaged espacialyy when it comes to tesing their memories against racing time. 







  **Wireframe**

The original website started by making sketches on paper, a rough work of what was intended to be created.  As the idea became clearer, the knowledge was transferred to [Balsamiq App](https://balsamiq.com/)for the design architechture and  the site wireframe was designed. Although, there were some minor changes in the design but mostly the layout on the app gave the guidance, a step by step guard to build the final website. Below is the link to the wireframe for the desktop and mobile devices.
