Climate Change Memory Game CCMG is practically an educative site, it is for those that care about the health of the planet earth. The goal is to provide an intuitive and interactive site which is user friendly to everyone in all ages and profession. The homepage provides educating information on climate change which includes some notable quotes of leaders across the world. While the game section is a card memory game whereby users are to match pairs. The cards are embossed with intriguing climate change-related imagery and terms such as GHG greenhouse gas molecules, climate change impact, and mitigations pictures. Users will use their memory and skill to match the pairs before the time finishes.

# **UX (USER EXPERIENCE)**

## Project objectives

The website's objective is mainly to sensitize the users on what climate change means, the effects it will have on users if humans continued to pollute it, and also to educate them on some main terminologies being used in climate change parlance especially in conferences. At the same time, the game section is not only played for the fun of it but to subliminally inform users on the factors that could impact the climate, what the climate will throw back at users when impacted, and also the mitigation and adaptation concepts which are the various pictures that laden the back and the front of the cards. Also, the fun aspect is irrepressible which comes with soft background music while competing against the time.

## Design Choices

The concept behind this site was borne out of love for the planet, how better humans can treat her so that this generation can bequeath her to the next generation. Also, the idea of building the game was inspired by a Youtube video [PortEXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ) that I watched on how a Halloween card was built.  I, therefore, thought of how to sensitize people on climate change impact, mitigation, and adaptation while at the same having fun.
I supposed the concept would be good for a memory game partly due to different images, colors, and above all the subconscious learning part of it. 

#### Fonts

[Google Fonts!](https://fonts.google.com/) Two main fonts were used for the whole sites:

* Supermercado for the body with fall back on san serif.
* Langar for the headers with fall back on san serif.

#### **Colour Scheme**

The developer used [eggradients](https://www.eggradients.com/shades-of-green-color) to choose colors that were used in creating the website. Particularly, 8 colors were used and they signify what the sites stands for.
  * RGBArgba(90, 150, 210, 0.95): this is a shade of light-blue which is very important in in nature and climate change, it also signifies healing and health for sustainable development.
  * #ffffff: it signify purity and pristine.
  * RGBA(255,36,0, 0.8): It is a shade of red for cheerfulness, energy, and enthusiasm for the future and hope those for that need support.
  * Goldenrod this is a shade of golden-yellow, it signifies worthiness.
  * rgba(0, 73, 83, 0.9): It is Sherpa Blue, it signifies the sky and the sea.
  * #777777: It is form of dark gray.
  * #FFBB89: It is Orange-like color which signifies creativity and vitality
  * rgba(195, 212, 37, 0.8)


 ## Content Section

For the game section, the cards will be laid out in a 4 by 4 grid for all devices. Users will start by clicking on a slightly dark transparent overlay. Once started the user will hear the music background and the clock will starts counting down. The game title will be at the top.  The cards will flip on clicking and players will have to match pairs. If they are wrong cards flip back and the player continues. When the cards match, that is, the center images at the card's front, it will sway in a dancing animation and remained card front, flipped.  If the user can't complete the game before the time runs out, there will be a Game over message accompanied with some melancholic sound for losing. In addition, there will be a click to restart message on the screen so that the user can click again on the screen to try again. If all the cards match, the user will get a victory message on the screen and click to restart message, also there will an upbeat victory sound. lastly, there would be a side-link to the left on the dark-overlay that will display the logo of the site which a user can click on to take them back to the homepage. The overall objective is to get users engaged.


 ## **Wireframe**

The original website started by making sketches on paper, a rough work of what was intended to be built.  As the idea became clearer, the knowledge was transferred to [Balsamiq App](https://balsamiq.com/)for the design architechture and  the site wireframe was designed. Although, there were some minor changes in the design but mostly the layout on the app gave the guidance, a step by step guard to build the final website. Below is the link to the wireframe for the desktop and mobile devices.

**View all**

# TESTING

***Sites Validation***

The following sites were used to validate the site HTML, CSS, and Javascript files respectively.

* [HTML-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input"): It validated the codes without any errors, view attached image here [HTML test](assets/testing/homepagehtml.png) and for the Game section  [HTML test](assets/testing/cardgamehtml.png).

* [CSS-validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input"): It checked the Styling syntax, without any errors, view attcahed image here [CSS test](assets/testing/homepagecss.png) and for the GAME section [CSS test](assets/testing/cardcss.png).

* [Jshint](https://jshint.com/): When using the tool about 15 warnings were flagged, the warnings have to do basicallly with the 'arrow function syntax (=>)' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6'). But I am sure confortable with it and the code is working perfectly,  however, I have taken note of that for next project. Also, there was another alert of one unused variable at the bottom. The variable was actually used and called in the home page section to control a "Read More" button. However, all the codes work perfectly. Below are the two images.
[Javascript test](assets/testing/jshint1.png) and [Javascript test](assets/testing/jshint15.png).

* Chrome DevTools
        [Javascript test](assets/testing/devToolz.png)
        [Lighthouse test](assets/testing/gamemobilLit.png)
        [Lighthouse test](assets/testing/lighthouse2.png)
     
* [Lighthouse Audit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse): Performance, and accessibility test was conducted using the lighthouse tool option on chrome developer tool and generated reports for the selected devices. This is to ensure the suitability and maximum performance for users. The first image was Intially generated for desktop view.

<img src="assets/testing/lighthousetest1.png">

The results above is 88%, after further cleaning and editing of the codes such as removal of used codes and properly nestling some divs, the second image was generated which is 91% performance, though the developer strive for 100% which could not be obtainable at the moment but hope to achieve in future project. Below is the second image generated.

<img src="assets/testing/lighthouse2.png">


The results for mobile is 92%, although it is not terrible for such a score but would strive to improve the score where needed to enhance it future performance. Below is the image from the mobile view.

<img src="assets/testing/gamemobiltest.png">

* Furthermore, the website was tested on the following: It works perfectly in them.

      * Systems: Macbook Pro Laptop, HP laptop, and Lenovo laptop.
      * Browsers: Chrome, Opera, Edge, Firefox, Safari
      * Phones and Tabs: iPad Pro, different Iphone series and androids

 * The page loads with a ready-to-use display such as **Click to Start**. 
 * Game starts on click and the timer starts counting down while the flip notes the number of flips the user makes. 
 * Since the aim of the game is to test user memory against the timer, the start click also starts the clock this is to maximize time. Below image is the start-up screen.

### *Active Game Mode and back of cards*

* The active view of the game has the game Title, Timer, flip counter, cards and background sound. 
* The card images enlarge when a player or user hovers over the back of the cards, it animates and grows toward the center of the card.
* The five images at the back of the card represent items which are very significant to climate change.
* In the following order, in a clockwise manner from the top; Left-Right-Right-Left and center, the images are Carbondioxide molecule (Co2), Nitrous oxide molecule N2O, methane molecule (CH4), chloroflourocarbon molecule (CFC) and image of the earth.
* Those images except that of the earth are greenhouse gas (GHG), which are the major anthropogenic factors that cause climate change
* All the images rotate clockwisely.

### *Front of cards*
 * When a user clicks on a card, it flips over and the card front view is displayed.
 * In the following order, in a clockwise manner from the top; Left-Right-Right-Left and center, the images are flood, desert, wildfire, pollution, and lastly are the valued images to be matched in the center and they are person cycling, vertical city, smartcity, urban farming, solar panel, windturbine, recycling, and tree planting.
* Those images except the ones at the center are the likely impact of climate change, while the ones in center are the likely mitigation and adaptation means to climate change.
* The card images enlarge when player or user hovers over the front of the cards, it animates and grows toward the center of the card. View image below.

* When a user clicks on card, the flip sound could be heard.
* When a pair of cards matches on clicks, the cards will sway left to right in dancing animation and a clapping sounds, while the matched cards remained face up.

* If the pair of cards did not match both cards will display momentarily and then flip back to be hidden.

## *Game Over and victory mood*

* There are different displays when the game ends, loser and winner.
* The won game screen displays victory with a resounding victory sound and an overlayed inscription "click to restart" as well as the side-link logo at the top-left. 
* When a user click on it, it returns him/her to the Welcome page (homepage).

* The lost game screen displays game over with a melancholy sound, and an overlayed click to restart.
* Also, a side-link site logo at the top-left, when clicked, it returns him/her to the Welcome page (homepage).

## Bugs and resolves

1. **Naviagational bar**
    * In the game section, the Naviagational bar overlaps the Timer and the Flip counter due to the height of the game container both on desktop and in mobile view.
    * In addition, in the mobile view of the game, the logo overlaps the timer and flip counter.

 ### Resolve
 * The issues was resolved by removing the navigation bar and footer, this is to give the game section a total game-like effect app, for the user to have a full views and control of the timer and flip counter.
 * Also, a side-link is design on the overlays which covers the site at the beginnning of the game and when the game ends, (either won or lost), the overlay display the side-link which has the site logo. When the logo is clicked it returns user to the Welcome page(homepage).

2. **Responsiveness**

* Intially, the following problems were identified
  <img src="assets/testing/mobileunfit.png">

 * The 2 layout columns was not good for the mobile view, it was not user-friendly, that was how the code was initially built.
 length of card was just too long for media of 600px and below.

 ### Resolve

* The problem was resolve by applying media query of max-width 600px, and changing the layout into 4 columns.
* The method worked for all the small mobile devices except Iphone 5 series. Again, I had to apply another media query of max-width 360px. That resolve problems of Responsiveness and compactibility. See here for the images [media@600](assets/testing/responsivecode2.png), and [media@360](assets/testing/mediaquerytwo.png)


3. **Toggle Issue**

    * There was an issue of a button that has to be clicked twice before it responded. The button was the Read More button in the centre of the jumbotron in the homepage. 
    * the major problem was because  <button class="btn btn-lg btn--cta btn--red hvr-grow-shadow read-moreButton expandToggle" onclick="readMore()">Read More..</button> the expandToggle class was used and also, in the Javascript the style was displayed none instead of block as can be seen in code below.
    {(var showContent = document.getElementById("showMoreContent1"); if (showContent.style.display === "none") )}


### Resolve 
* The class expandToggle was removed and the style-display was changed from none to block.


4. **White Card Background**
One bug that was lastly resolved was on the game's card background. When the cards flip, its background is white. the card is not supposed to have a white background when it is flipping, although when card flips completely , the white background does not show. I did lot of researches on it and almost gave up on it until the solution finaly. 

<img src="assets/testing/whitebkg.png">

### Resolve 
* The simple solution is to set the cards' class background to transparent. [.card{ background-color: transparent; border-color: transparent;} ]
